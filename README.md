# SYDE-544 Biomedical Measurements and Signal Processing
## This repository consists of assignments done in Syde 544
## The final Assignment is a project where we made an EMG and tested it against an OTS EMG, details of which can be found in the presentation file inside Final Assignment
## If this was linked on my resume for Signal Processing, perhaps consider looking at Assignment 3 or the project that was linked on the Resume
